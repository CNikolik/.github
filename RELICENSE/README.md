# Permission to Relicense

This directory collects grants from contributors to permit relicensing the Chrsyalis Blockchain project code.

Please create a separate file in this directory for each individual contributor, named after the individual holding the copyright.

Each patch must be made with a GitHub handle that is clearly associated with the copyright owner, to guarantee the identity of the signatory. Please avoid changing the files created by other individuals granting a copyright license over their copyrights (if rewording is required contact them and ask them to submit an updated version). This makes it easier to verify that the license grant was made by an authorized GitHub account.

## Why Sign?

Most open source software projects have a contributor license agreement to stop people from licensing code they don't own. This relicensing agreement accomplishes this aim and also allows the project to change software licenses as it develops.

## First Time Contributors

Please fork this repository and add **{{your_github_username}}.md** in this folder with the following relicensing grant. You will then be invited to the organization.
